# Wallaby.js

**To get wallaby.js working** after you have generated your project with `angular-cli`, you'll need to do the following:
- Configure Jest CLI as [described in the `jest-angular-preset` docs](https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular#installation).
- Add the [wallaby.js config file](https://github.com/wallabyjs/ngCliWebpackSample/blob/jest/wallaby.js) to the project.
